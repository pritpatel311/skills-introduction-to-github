# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Stock Analyzer
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A website where you input any stock you want to buy and it will analyze its data that It has access to tell you whether or not to buy the stock.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
I would most likely use python and use Monte Carlo approximations as aid in this project.
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Poojan Desai, tut18125@temple.edu, Yihan Zhang
TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I need the code to work as I want to implement it into to using real money
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?


TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I hope to atleast have the code working I can work on website design later
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
To make a bot that tells when to buy or sell stocks, IÕll need to learn about stock market analysis and trading indicators like RSI and moving averages. IÕll also need to get better at coding in Python and learn how to use trading APIs to access live stock data.one person could handle data and strategies, another could focus on coding and APIs, and the third could develop the botÕs notifications.
